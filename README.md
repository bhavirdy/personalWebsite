# JavaScript Personal Portfolio Site built in Github Codespaces using a Github template

## About this portfolio template

This repo was built from a GitHub template of a *JavaScript personal portfolio* frontend web application using the *React framework*. 

The Github template can be found at: https://github.com/education/codespaces-project-template-js

The template supported active learning by:

* Providing detailed explanation throughout the template customation process.

* Being easily customizable. 

* Having seperate components for each section of the site, and thus information needs to be set in only one spot. 

  * Which was not only for ease of updating, but so one can see how prop values are passed to React components.
